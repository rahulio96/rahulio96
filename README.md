## Hi, I'm Rahul 👋

I am a dedicated third-year student at California State University Sacramento, who is passionate about pursuing a career in software engineering. I aim to expand my knowledge and experience in the field, and to constantly seek new opportunities to enhance my skills and make meaningful contributions.

<!--### CodeDay Labs Internship -->
During the summer of 2023, I was a software engineer intern at CodeDay, working to resolve multiple issues on the [npm CLI](https://github.com/npm/cli/) along with my teammate, [Aaron](https://github.com/AaronHamilton965). Our first two contributions were included in **[npm v9.8.1](https://github.com/npm/cli/releases/tag/v9.8.1)**, and the rest were made available in **[npm v10.0.0](https://github.com/npm/cli/releases/tag/v10.0.0)**! 

Pull requests merged during the internship: 
1. [fix: much clearer npx 'canceled' error](https://github.com/npm/cli/pull/6642) 
2. [docs: Added steps for using npm/npx locally to CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/npm/cli/pull/6643) 
3. [fix: prefix in .npmrc error log](https://github.com/npm/cli/pull/6685) 
4. [fix: exclude non-root README.md/LICENSE files](https://github.com/npm/npm-packlist/pull/173)

Having the world's biggest software registry and being the most widely-used JavaScript package manager, npm has over 17 million users, and we hope that our changes can enhance the experience for them.

<!--### Vendia Inc. Project -->
The most recent group project I worked on was a **[Pharmaceutical Study Web Application](https://github.com/rahulio96/Pharmaceutical-Study-Web-App-Project)** using React.js and Firebase for start-up company [Vendia Inc.](https://www.vendia.com/) I co-led the project and worked extensively with our group leader, [Angelo](https://github.com/Angkaram), to engineer a web app tailored for the client. 

The repository's [README.md](https://github.com/rahulio96/Pharmaceutical-Study-Web-App-Project/blob/main/README.md) contains concepts, engineering documents, a video demonstration, and a link to the deployed project. 

Please feel free to check out any of the links above if interested, and thanks for reading!
