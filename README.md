## Hi, I'm Rahul 👋

I am a dedicated third-year student at California State University Sacramento, who is passionate about pursuing a career in software engineering. I aim to expand my knowledge and experience in the field, and to constantly seek new opportunities to enhance my skills and make meaningful contributions.

<!--### CodeDay Labs Internship -->
During the summer of 2023, I was a software engineer intern at CodeDay, working to resolve multiple issues on the [npm CLI](https://github.com/npm/cli/) along with my teammate, [Aaron](https://github.com/AaronHamilton965). Our first two contributions were included in [npm v9.8.1](https://github.com/npm/cli/releases/tag/v9.8.1), and the rest were made available in [npm v10.0.0](https://github.com/npm/cli/releases/tag/v10.0.0)! 

<!--### Vendia Inc. Project -->
The most recent group project I worked on was a [Pharmaceutical Study Web Application](https://github.com/rahulio96/Pharmaceutical-Study-Web-App-Project) using React.js and Firebase for start-up company [Vendia Inc.](https://www.vendia.com/) I co-led the project and worked extensively with our group leader, [Angelo](https://github.com/Angkaram), to engineer a web app tailored for the client.
