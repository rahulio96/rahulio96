### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a third-year student at California State University Sacramento, and I am passionate about pursuing a career in software engineering. I am incredibly dedicated to gaining knowledge and experience in the field and I am seeking opportunities to not only improve my current skillset but to expand on it further.
