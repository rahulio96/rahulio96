## Hi, I'm Rahul 👋

I am a third-year student at California State University Sacramento, and I am passionate about pursuing a career in software engineering. I am incredibly dedicated to gaining knowledge and experience in the field and I am seeking opportunities to not only improve my current skillset but to expand on it further.

The most recent project I worked on was a Pharmaceutical Study React JS web application for Vendia Inc. I co-leaded the project and worked extensively with our group leader, Angelo ([@angkaram](https://github.com/Angkaram)), to concept, design, develop, and test a secure and user-friendly web application to suit the client's needs.
