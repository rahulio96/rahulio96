## Hi, I'm Rahul 👋

I am a dedicated rising third-year student at California State University Sacramento, who is passionate about pursuing a career in software engineering. I aim to expand my knowledge and experience in the field, and to constantly seek new opportunities to enhance my skills and make meaningful contributions.

<!--### CodeDay Labs Internship -->
Currently, I am a software engineer intern at CodeDay working to resolve issues on the [npm cli](https://github.com/npm/cli/) along with my teammate, [Aaron](https://github.com/AaronHamilton965).

Our recent contributions have been included in **[npm v9.8.1](https://github.com/npm/cli/releases/tag/v9.8.1)**, and we remain committed to making more contributions. Being the world's biggest software registry, npm has over **17 million users**, and we hope that our changes can enhance the experience for them.

<!--### Vendia Inc. Project -->
The most recent group project I worked on was a **[Pharmaceutical Study Web App](https://github.com/rahulio96/Pharmaceutical-Study-Web-App-Project)** using React.js for start-up company Vendia Inc. I co-led the project and worked extensively with our group leader, [Angelo](https://github.com/Angkaram), to engineer a web app tailored for the client. 

The repository's [README.md](https://github.com/rahulio96/Pharmaceutical-Study-Web-App-Project/blob/main/README.md) contains concepts, engineering documents, a video demonstration, and a link to the deployed project.
