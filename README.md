## Hi, I'm Rahul 👋

I am a dedicated third-year student at California State University Sacramento, who is passionate about pursuing a career in software engineering. I aim to expand my knowledge and experience in the field, and to constantly seek new opportunities to enhance my skills and make meaningful contributions.

The most recent and significant project I worked on was a Pharmaceutical Study React JS web application for Vendia Inc. I co-led the project and worked extensively with our group leader, Angelo ([@angkaram](https://github.com/Angkaram)), to concept, design, develop, and test a secure and user-friendly web application to suit the client's needs.
