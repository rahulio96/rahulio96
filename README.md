## Hi, I'm Rahul 👋

I am a dedicated student at California State University Sacramento, passionate about pursuing a career in software engineering. I aim to expand my knowledge in the field, and seek new opportunities to make meaningful contributions.

Currently, I'm a volunteer software developer at an early-stage start-up!

<!--### CodeDay Labs Internship -->
During the summer of 2023, I was a software engineer intern at [CodeDay](https://www.codeday.org/), working to resolve multiple issues on the [npm CLI](https://github.com/npm/cli/) along with my teammate, [Aaron](https://github.com/AaronHamilton965). Our first two contributions were included in [npm v9.8.1](https://github.com/npm/cli/releases/tag/v9.8.1) and the rest were made available in [npm v10.0.0](https://github.com/npm/cli/releases/tag/v10.0.0), which delivered improvements to error handling, documentation, and package publishing to over 17 million npm users!

<!--### Vendia Inc. Project -->
I also helped develop and design a [Pharmaceutical Study Web App](https://github.com/Angkaram/Pharmaceutical-Study-Web-App-Project) using React.js and Firebase for start-up company [Vendia Inc](https://www.vendia.com/), which was designed to incorporate Vendia's technology to simulate a pharmaceutical study. I co-led the project and worked extensively with the team leader, [Angelo](https://github.com/Angkaram), to engineer and present a web app tailored to the client's needs.
